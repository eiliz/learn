The program that will solve this problem has several separate issues we will have to handle. 


One issue is the doubling of digits, which is tricky because doubled digits are determined from the right end of the identification number.

 Remember, we’re not going to read and store all of the digits and then process. We’re going to process as we go. The problem is that we’ll be getting the digits left to right, but we really need them right to left in order to know which digits to double. We would know which digits to double if we knew how many digits were in the identification number, but we don’t because the problem states that the identification number is of arbitrary length. Another issue is that doubled numbers 10 and greater must be treated according to their individual digits. Also, we have to determine when we’ve read the whole identification number. Finally, we have to figure out how to read the number digit by digit. In other words, the user is going to enter one long number, but we want to read it as though the digits were entered as separate numbers.
